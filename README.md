guidelines-via-code
===================

multiple tableviews
This is a second attempt at producing the same thing but using code. 
Unfortunately I'm a little stuck at how to get the segues to work between the various views. 
So basically I've created an outline of tableviews and the idea would be in the main menu choose guidelines and go to the systemtable
tableview. Or select the helpful info and go to the helpfulinfo tableview and when there be able to go to the 
PO switch or Contact info view controllers.

Again I'm very new at this so maybe I'm going about this in completely the wrong way? 
Any advice would be greatly apprecaited thanks!!!
